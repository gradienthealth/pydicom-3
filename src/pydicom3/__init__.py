"""pydicom package -- easily handle DICOM files.
   See Quick Start below.

-----------
Quick Start
-----------

1. A simple program to read a dicom file, modify a value, and write to a new
   file::

    from pydicom3.filereader import dcmread
    dataset = dcmread("file1.dcm")
    dataset.PatientName = 'anonymous'
    dataset.save_as("file2.dcm")

2. See the files in the examples directory that came with this package for more
   examples, including some interactive sessions.

3. Learn the methods of the Dataset class; that is the one you will work with
   most directly.

4. Questions and comments can be directed to the pydicom google group:
   https://groups.google.com/g/pydicom

5. Bugs and other issues can be reported in the issue tracker:
   https://www.github.com/pydicom/pydicom
